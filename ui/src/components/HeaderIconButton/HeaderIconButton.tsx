/**
 * The one header chrome control.
 *
 * #80 §0.7 asked for this by name — "a single shared 'header icon button' style would prevent
 * this" — after the header's controls were found to be a custom button, an antd circle button, and
 * an antd circle button wrapped in a badge span, with three different alignments.
 *
 * What made it worth building even though they had converged on 36×36: they agreed by COINCIDENCE.
 * `ThemeToggle` set `style={{ height: 36, width: 36 }}` inline in its TSX; `Notifications` set the
 * same numbers in a CSS module. Two people wrote 36 twice, and nothing kept them writing it. The
 * inline pair was also invisible to the token lint, which only reads `.module.css` — so the header
 * was the one place a hardcoded size could drift without any check noticing.
 *
 * Size comes from `layout.headerIconSize` via a CSS variable, so there is now one number.
 *
 * NOT a home for the search trigger: that is a labelled pill with an icon, a placeholder and a
 * keyboard hint, not an icon button. Forcing it in here would make this component a shape it is
 * not, which is how shared components stop being shared.
