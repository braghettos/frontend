/**
 * Autopilot COMPOSER DRAFT STORE — the rail's textarea draft plus the one thing the
 * draft alone cannot tell you: WHERE THE WORDS CAME FROM.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (two reasons, one store):
 *
 * 1. REMOUNT SURVIVAL. The draft used to live in `AutopilotRail`'s `useState`. The rail
 *    hangs under `<RouterProvider key={routerVersion}>` (App.tsx), so a routes-as-data
 *    reload remounts it and resets every `useState` — silently wiping a half-written
 *    question. Same failure the transcript had, same fix: a module-level singleton read
 *    through `useSyncExternalStore` (see conversationStore.ts's header for the full story).
 *
 * 2. PROVENANCE, for speak-back. Autopilot speaks an answer back ONLY when the question
 *    was asked BY VOICE — concretely, when the composer text was composed PURELY of
 *    dictated segments with no manual typing mixed in. That is a property of HOW the
 *    draft was built, not of the string itself: "scale payments to three" is
 *    indistinguishable from the same sentence typed. So it is MODELLED EXPLICITLY here
 *    (`provenance`) rather than inferred later, and it travels with the draft through the
 *    remount for the same reason the text does — a remount mid-compose must not silently
 *    downgrade a dictated draft to a typed one (or, worse, upgrade a typed one).
 *
 * THE PROVENANCE LATTICE (deliberately one-way, and deliberately conservative):
 *
 *     empty ──appendDictatedSegment──► dictated ──setTypedDraft──► typed
 *       │                                                            ▲
 *       └────────────────── setTypedDraft ───────────────────────────┘
 *
 *   - `dictated` survives further dictation and nothing else.
 *   - ANY keyboard edit (a keystroke, a deletion, a paste — every one of them arrives as
 *     the textarea's onChange) moves the draft to `typed` and it never moves back. One
 *     typed character is enough: the trigger is "purely dictated", not "mostly dictated".
 *   - Emptying the draft returns it to `empty`, so the NEXT draft starts clean: a typed
 *     question that was deleted must not poison a subsequent dictated one.
 *
 * DICTATION DOES NOT EXIST YET. `appendDictatedSegment` is the seam the future capture
 * code will call (microphone capture needs a secure context, which no current Krateo
 * deployment has — see the voice spec §1.3). It is written, typed and unit-tested now so
 * that when transcription lands it has exactly one way in, and speak-back's trigger is
 * already correct on the day it starts firing.
 *
 * NOT PERSISTED to localStorage, on purpose: a draft is in-flight user speech/typing, and
 * the voice spec (FR 39) allows only the transcript and the speak-back preference on disk.
 * A module singleton survives the remount; a page reload legitimately starts fresh.
 *
 * No React imports here (pure store); the rail adapts it via useSyncExternalStore.
