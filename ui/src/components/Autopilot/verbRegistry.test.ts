 *   - a sideEffect:'write' entry is rejected exactly like an unknown verb;
 *   - each seeded read verb resolves and dispatches through the injected handler.

 * The effect on a reader was the opposite of honest — the model proposes the verb, nothing happens,
 * and no chip appears. An UNREGISTERED verb produced exactly the same silence.
 *
 * The fix lives in actionBridge (`refused`), which turns every null into a read-only chip naming
 * the verb. These tests pin the stubs' contract so the behaviour they rely on cannot drift.
