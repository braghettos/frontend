/**
 * RECORDER — microphone in, one compressed blob out. No network, ever.
 * Voice spec FR 7, 12, 13, 23, 27, 56, 66.
 *
 * THE LOUDNESS GATE IS THE REASON THIS FILE MEASURES ANYTHING (FR 66). The same
 * `AnalyserNode` that powers the level meter and the silence auto-stop also tracks the
 * PEAK RMS OF THE WHOLE RECORDING, and if that peak never crossed the speech threshold
 * the blob is NOT UPLOADED AT ALL — a muted microphone, the wrong input device, or a mic
 * held by another application produces `no-speech`, not a request.
 *
 * That is not an optimisation. Thirty seconds of silence still bills ~960 audio tokens,
 * so it sails straight through the token-arithmetic gate on the response side; and the
 * measured behaviour of the model when it has nothing to transcribe is not an empty
 * string or an error — it is a confident, fluent, entirely invented sentence. The two
 * gates close different halves of the same hole: this one catches audio that reached the
 * model carrying nothing, the response gate catches audio that never reached it.
 *
 * WHY EVERYTHING IS INJECTED. jsdom has no `getUserMedia`, no `MediaRecorder` and no
 * `AudioContext`, so none of this is testable against the real platform. `RecorderDeps`
 * is the entire surface the recorder needs; `browserRecorderDeps()` is the ONE place the
 * real globals are read, and tests hand in a fake that can be silent, loud, slow, or
 * broken on demand.
 *
 * THE TRACKS ARE ALWAYS STOPPED (FR 23). Every exit — success, cancel, error, auto-stop,
 * a permission revoked mid-recording — runs through `release()`. A live-microphone
 * indicator left burning in the browser tab after a failed dictation is the single most
 * alarming thing this feature could do, and it would be a bug the user cannot fix.
