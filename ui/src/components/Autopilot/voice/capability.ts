/**
 * CAPABILITY GATE — the pure predicate that decides whether the microphone control
 * exists at all. Voice spec FR 1–6.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF THE TESTS IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it is `isSecureContext` FIRST.
 *
 * `getUserMedia` and `MediaRecorder` being present is a PROVEN FALSE POSITIVE for "this
 * browser can record": on a plain-HTTP origin some browsers still expose the constructors
 * and only fail at call time, and the great majority of Krateo installs are still plain
 * HTTP (the portal is HTTPS now, but every deployment that has not enabled TLS is not).
 * Testing the APIs first would render a microphone button that can only ever produce a
 * permission error. So the context is tested before anything else touches `navigator`.
 *
 * THE URL IS THE ON/OFF SWITCH (FR 4). There is no `AUTOPILOT_VOICE_ENGINE` and no
 * boolean: the transcription endpoint is configuration, ABSENT BY DEFAULT, and with it
 * unset the control does not render and the composer's DOM is byte-identical to what it
 * was before this feature existed. The dedicated `/stt/v1` route this feature wants is
 * still with the platform team, so nothing is hard-coded — not `/llm/v1`, not the gateway
 * origin, not a path. Whatever the operator configures is where the audio goes.
 *
 * UNAVAILABLE IS HIDDEN, NOT GREYED. A permanently disabled microphone on every
 * plain-HTTP portal would be a permanent indicator for the DEFAULT state, which the
 * house rule forbids (status markers are exception-only). One `console.info` on first
 * rail open names the reason and the origin so an operator can act on it; the UI says
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * Pure and window-injectable: jsdom has neither `MediaRecorder` nor `getUserMedia`, so
 * every branch here is unit-testable by handing in a fake global.
