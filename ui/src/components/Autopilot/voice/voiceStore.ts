/**
 * VOICE STORE — the dictation session, at module scope. Voice spec FR 42–45, 62, 63.
 *
 * WHY MODULE-LEVEL, exactly as `conversationStore.ts` and `composerDraftStore.ts` are.
 * The rail hangs under `<RouterProvider key={routerVersion}>`; a routes-as-data reload
 * remounts that whole subtree and resets every `useState`. Mid-dictation that would kill
 * the microphone with no UI left to stop it, or orphan an in-flight upload whose result
 * has nowhere to land. So the live `MediaStream`, the recorder handle and the in-flight
 * `AbortController` all live OUT HERE, and a rail that re-mounts while this store is
 * `listening` re-hydrates into `listening` with the same timer (FR 42, 63).
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, stated plainly: end to end in the app that remount still ENDS the dictation,
 * because two things outside this file kill it on the way through — `AutopilotProvider`'s
 * unmount cleanup, and the rail's `open` flag, which is component state and so comes back
 * `false`, firing the collapse teardown. Closing the gap means making `open` survive the
 * remount too; until then the microphone is stopped rather than left running behind a rail
 * that came back shut. See the comment on that cleanup in `AutopilotProvider.tsx`.
 *
 * THE ONE WAY IN AND OUT:
 *
 *     microphone ─► recorder.ts ─► transcribe.ts ─► composerDraftStore.appendDictatedSegment
 *
 * The last hop is the seam the composer draft store was built for. The transcript enters
 * the draft through the SAME path typed text uses (FR 62) — never by DOM mutation, so the
 * textarea's OpenAPI paste capture is not tripped by a transcript — and it lands with the
 * provenance that decides whether the answer is spoken back.
 *
 * CONVERSATION MODE (FR 11, revised by the owner). Pressing the microphone is a spoken
 * TURN, not a dictation aid: when the transcript lands and every word in the draft came
 * from speech, the turn is sent without a Send press, the answer is spoken back (FR 67),
 * and BOTH halves are written into the chat transcript like any typed turn — a spoken
 * exchange leaves exactly the same readable record, which is what an incident review
 * reads afterwards.
 *
 * That does NOT relax the fence. This directory still imports neither the transport nor
 * the provider, and the ESLint rule that makes that structural still stands: the store
 * cannot reach `send()`, it can only report that a spoken turn is COMPLETE. The decision
 * to submit is made outside the fence by the rail, which injects the handler through
 * `installConversationSink` — the same dependency arrow as `installTranscribeDeps`, which
 * carries the portal bearer, the rate-limit detector and the session resume in.
 *
 * A draft the keyboard has touched is never auto-sent. `appendDictatedSegment` keeps a
 * typed draft `typed` forever, so a half-written question you are dictating INTO stays
 * yours to send: the sink fires only on a `dictated` draft.
 *
 * BARGE-IN (FR 75): starting capture CANCELS speak-back first, before the microphone is
 * opened, so the synthesiser is never recorded reading the previous answer back.
