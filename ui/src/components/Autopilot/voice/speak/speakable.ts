/**
 * SPEAKABLE — the pure, local, synchronous transform from an assistant message into the
 * words a synthesiser says. Voice spec §3.3/§3.4, FR 68 / 70 / 71 / 72.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT (FR 68, and the reason this file has no dependencies worth speaking of):
 * the spoken text is a RENDERING OF THE EXACT STRING ALREADY WRITTEN IN THE CHAT —
 * `message.text` after finalize. It is never a separately generated spoken summary and
 * there is never a second model call on this path. Autopilot proposes changes against
 * live clusters: a user who HEARS one account of what the agent found while the
 * transcript RECORDS another has no way to know which one the agent will act on, and the
 * written record is what an incident review reads afterwards. Everything here is
 * deterministic — same input, same output, no clock, no network, no randomness.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT DECIDES EVERY CASE BELOW: a construct that conveys SHAPE rather than
 * PROSE is SKIPPED — not recited, and no longer announced either. Reading an indented
 * YAML manifest aloud character by character is not a degraded experience, it is an
 * actively hostile one; a linearised table is noise. Prose — paragraphs, headings, list
 * items, inline code, resource names — is spoken as written. Everything else is silent.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT IS A REVERSAL. This file used to ANNOUNCE the shapes it skipped
 * ("Code block, 12 lines of YAML, shown in the chat") and to append an action sentence
 * ("This answer proposes an action: X. Confirm it in the chat."), the latter documented as
 * FR 71's one permitted addition, on the argument that a listener hearing only prose would
 * never learn the answer proposes a change.
 *
 * In use that argument lost to a simpler one: the additions made the voice read things the
 * user had not asked it to read, on every reply carrying a manifest — which is most of
 * them. The narration competed with the answer. Reported directly: "it reads too much. It
 * should read only the text chat, not the proposed action or other stuff."
 *
 * The honesty concern FR 71 protected is real, but it is already carried visually: the
 * action chip renders in the chat, unmissable, and nothing is applied without pressing it.
 * Speech was never the confirmation surface — the chip is. So the spoken rendering is now
 * strictly a SUBSET of the written text: prose, in order, nothing added.
 *
 * ONE EXCEPTION SURVIVES — the FR 72 truncation tail. A capped answer that simply stops
 * mid-thought is not "less narration", it is a listener believing they heard all of it.
 * That is a comprehension failure rather than chattiness, so the tail stays.
