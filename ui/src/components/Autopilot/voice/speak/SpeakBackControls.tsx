/**
 * SPEAK-BACK CHROME — the two surfaces the feature needs in the rail, kept out of
 * AutopilotRail.tsx so the rail stays inside its 500-line budget.
 *
 *   SpeakBackToggle  — the preference, in the rail header beside New thread and Collapse.
 *   SpeakBackStatus  — the speaking indicator + Stop, the FR 78 refusal recovery, the
 *                      FR 77 first-use line, and the FR 31 live region.
 *
 * WHY THE PREFERENCE IS HERE AND NOT ON A MESSAGE. The owner's trigger decision removes
 * the per-message "Read aloud" control the published spec proposed, so there is no
 * per-answer surface to hang an on/off switch on. And it cannot live behind a menu: there
 * is no `prefers-reduced-motion` equivalent for audio, and no reliable way to detect a
 * screen reader, so the off switch has to be findable BEFORE the first answer is ever
 * spoken by someone who does not want to be spoken to (FR 76/77).
 *
 * WHY STOP IS IN THE STATUS ROW AND NOT ON SEND. By the time speech runs, the turn has
 * finalized and the composer button has already reverted from the turn-level Stop back to
 * Send — reusing it would mean one control with two different meanings a second apart.
 *
 * Raw `<button>` + CSS modules + the inline stroke SVGs from `icons.tsx`: this is app
 * chrome under `src/components/`, where the antd-mirror rule does not bind.
