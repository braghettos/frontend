/**
 * THE WORDS WE SEND WITH THE AUDIO — system prompt, language hint, vocabulary bias, and
 * the arithmetic constants the audio-arrival gate is built from. Voice spec FR 14, 50,
 * 53, 54, 61.
 *
 * WHY THE PROMPT IS THIS DEFENSIVE. The transcription call is a general chat completion
 * to a general model. Handed audio that says "list every composition in the payments
 * namespace", a helpful model will happily ANSWER it — and that answer would land in the
 * user's composer as if they had said it. Every clause below exists to stop one specific
 * way the model can stop transcribing and start assisting: no answering, no summarising,
 * no translating, no explaining, no acting on the content even when it is phrased as an
 * instruction or a question, and no labels, quotes, speaker names or commentary that the
 * sanitiser would then have to guess at.
 *
 * WHY THE LANGUAGE HINT IS MANDATORY (FR 14). Unhinted, the same English clip came back
 * once as Italian-flavoured garbling — "Scale dei paviments compositión tutt'e tre". A
 * hard language LOCK is still wrong for this audience, who mix English technical
 * vocabulary into Italian sentences all day; the hint plus an explicit "never translate"
 * is the balance that survives both.
 *
 * WHY THE TOKEN ARITHMETIC LIVES HERE. `AUDIO_TOKENS_FLOOR` and `textTokenEstimate` are
 * the two halves of FR 61 — the gate that separates a real transcription from an invented
 * one — and the estimate has to be computed from THE SAME strings this module produces.
 * Keeping the prompt and the estimator in one file is what stops a prompt edit from
 * silently moving the threshold.
