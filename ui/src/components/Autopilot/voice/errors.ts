/**
 * DICTATION ERROR VOCABULARY — the closed set of things that can go wrong between the
 * microphone and the composer, and the exact words the user is shown for each (voice
 * spec FR 21).
 *
 * It lives in its own module because BOTH halves of capture need it and neither may
 * import the other: `recorder.ts` (which never touches the network) raises `denied`,
 * `no-mic` and `no-speech`, and `transcribe.ts` (which never touches the microphone)
 * raises the rest. A shared error type is the only thing they have in common.
 *
 * TWO OF THESE CODES ARE THE SAFETY FEATURE, not error handling:
 *
 *   · `no-audio`  — the response came back fluent and confident, but the token
 *                   arithmetic proves the model never received any audio, so the text is
 *                   a fabrication (FR 61, §1.2). Measured: a request whose audio the
 *                   gateway silently discarded returned "Hi, John. Can you recommend me
 *                   some, uh, sci-fi movies that released in 2024?" with
 *                   `finish_reason: "stop"`, for audio that said something else entirely.
 *   · `no-speech` — the microphone was open but never heard anything above the speech
 *                   threshold (FR 66), so nothing is uploaded at all. Thirty seconds of
 *                   silence still bills ~960 audio tokens and would sail through the
 *                   `no-audio` arithmetic, and the model writes a plausible sentence
 *                   anyway when it has nothing to transcribe.
 *
 * Both say "nothing was added" in as many words, because the one thing the user must be
 * able to trust is that a failure NEVER leaves invented text in the composer.
