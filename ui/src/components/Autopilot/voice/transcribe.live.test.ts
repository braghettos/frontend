/**
 * The one test that is not a fake: the real `transcribeRecording` against the real `/stt/v1`.
 *
 * Everything else in this directory proves the code behaves correctly against stubs. That is
 * necessary and not sufficient — the two things that could still be wrong are the ones no stub
 * can settle, because both are properties of the backend rather than of us:
 *
 *   1. the shipped container. Browsers record `audio/webm;codecs=opus`; the only format ever
 *      proven to reach Vertex through this gateway was WAV, produced by hand. If Opus-in-WebM
 *      were rejected, every real dictation would fail as a generic `no-speech` or `engine`
 *      error, and no unit test would have said a word about it.
 *   2. `AUDIO_TOKENS_FLOOR`. The anti-fabrication gate rejects a response whose token count
 *      shows no audio arrived. Set too high, it rejects genuine transcriptions instead — and
 *      it was calibrated on a single WAV clip, in a format the client is forbidden to send.
 *
 * So this test sends real Opus to the real route with a real bearer and asserts both. It is
 * skipped unless `VOICE_LIVE=1`, because it needs a reachable cluster and a credential and
 * spends a model call. Run it when the route changes, the model changes, or before release:
 *
 *   VOICE_LIVE=1 \
 *   VOICE_STT_URL=https://portal.krateo.dev/stt/v1/chat/completions \
 *   VOICE_TOKEN="$(cat <a fresh portal bearer>)" \
 *   VOICE_FIXTURE=/tmp/voice-probe.webm \
 *   VOICE_EXPECT="scale the payments composition" \
 *     npx vitest run src/components/Autopilot/voice/transcribe.live.test.ts
 *
 * The fixture is any short spoken clip; `VOICE_EXPECT` is a lowercase substring of what it says,
 * loose enough to survive ordinary recognition variance. Speech recognition is not deterministic,
 * so this asserts the transcript is *plausibly the clip* — not an exact string.
