/**
 * Pins the same-path query MERGE, which had no test despite being load-bearing.
 *
 * Every independent filter control navigates with only its OWN param — the compositions status
 * chips emit `?status=failed`, the range chips `?range=7d`. Without merging, each click would
 * clobber the others and filters could never compose. Autopilot's `setExtras` rides the same
 * dispatcher, and `buildExtrasPath` deliberately builds a bare `pathname?whitelisted-only` URL
 * BECAUSE this merge restores the rest.
 *
 * That indirection is exactly why an audit read `buildExtrasPath` in isolation, saw
 * `new URLSearchParams()`, and reported that Autopilot silently discards every other URL param.
 * It does not — but nothing in the codebase demonstrated that, and a plausible "fix" would have
 * double-merged. These tests make the contract visible at the seam where it actually lives.
